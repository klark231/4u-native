// Touch controls for phones, in the Monster Hunter style (the MHGU port's runtime/touch.cpp, MIT, made over for the
// 3DS's buttons): bronze-rimmed dark discs with cream glyphs and the game's button letter on a small badge.
//   - left thumb: a stick fixed at its place (the knob follows the thumb inside the rim); a light tilt walks, a full
//     one runs, and the thumb well past the rim dashes (R held, with the weapon sheathed: show_stick_run); lifted
//     inside the small circle with a padlock that shows above the stick (lit while the thumb is on it), the run locks
//     (Call of Duty's sprint lock) and goes on forward until the stick or the circle is touched again, the weapon comes
//     out or a menu opens. With show_stick_run 0 a Run button above the attacks runs while held
//   - right thumb: the attack pill (A on its upper half, X on the lower, both on its seam: the 3DS's X draws and
//     attacks, A attacks, gathers, carves and talks), R guard / dash beside its lower end, B evade / crouch beside it,
//     Y sheathe (or the item, sheathed) left of it; on an arc above it ZR (the kick; once a quest is complete, Skip:
//     the port's kick and skip options), ZL (the target camera: the port's target option, the touch screen's panel)
//     and L (the camera behind the hunter, or on the target; held, the lock-on: the camera keeps turning to the monster,
//     as in the newer games, until held again; a tap on its padlock too, and a controller's right stick click). START
//     (the game's menu), the touch screen's corner and the settings at the left edge
//   - in a menu of the game's the layout stays, faded so that the window reads under it, and the menu pad comes in
//     under the right thumb (the MHGU port's, the same place, look and timing): a small pad that is the d-pad (a wide
//     dead middle, one direction at a time, the knob under the thumb), L and R as tabs above it, a small SELECT below
//     it while the hunt's is hidden; the buttons its tabs cover go while it shows. The stick moves the cursor too (the
//     circle pad), and a drag anywhere else steps it, a step every so far, as a list on a phone
//   - the game's own HUD is touched where it is drawn (the hooks say where: Port::Hooks::GameState::hud). The item bar:
//     a tap uses the item (Y; with the weapon out, Y puts it away and the item is used once it is away), a swipe turns
//     the bar (the hooks take the game's own step, as the touch screen's bar does: the strip follows the finger; no L,
//     which would turn the camera too), a long press holds it open with its neighbours (and a bow's coatings) while a
//     swipe turns it; with a bow or a bowgun, up or down changes the ammo or the coating (L held with X or B). The
//     target camera's icon (the single-screen mod's, on the top screen) takes no finger: while the lock-on is on a
//     gold ring goes round it (the padlock on L turns the lock-on)
//   - with a bow or a bowgun in hand, in a hunt, a layout of their own: a large button under the thumb that fires
//     (a drag on it, held, aims: the right thumb can't be on the screen and on a button at once), a smaller one that
//     reloads (a bow: its melee attack), aim, crouching fire (a bow: its coating), evade, sheathe, and arrows for the
//     ammo. Laid out on its own in the editor
//   - up to six combined buttons of the player's own (the settings' Buttons on the screen: A+X, say), each pressing
//     its buttons together; placed in the editor
//   - anywhere else: dragging turns the camera by the angle moved, as in a phone game (the port's camera hook while the
//     game's camera takes it, Port::Hooks::CameraTurnActive; elsewhere as the C-stick); a double tap centres it (L)
//   - the touch screen's corner, while it shows, is the game's: a finger there is the stylus, and the controls it would
//     cover move out from under it, the whole side's group together (above it when they fit, else beside it). Its
//     button (the 3DS's two screens) shows and hides it
// Every control can be moved and resized (the layout editor: a long press on the settings button), kept in
// touch_layout.txt in the app's folder, with which buttons show and the opacity. The editor moves the game's HUD too,
// part by part (the clock, the health and stamina bars, the sharpness, the name plates, the area's map, the target
// camera, the item bar: the hooks move the game's own layout objects; hud_<part> in mh4u.ini). Shown while no controller is
// connected (controls auto), always (on) or never (off: the settings button alone).
