// The app's side of the network rooms (mh4n/rooms.h, Azahar's multiplayer rooms): joining, hosting and leaving from
// the settings panel's Multiplayer tab, the room's chat and notices kept as lines, and a lobby's list of rooms fetched
// on a thread of its own. The runtime's local-wireless service talks to the process's room client by itself, so a room
// joined here is the one the game's Local Play (the Gathering Hall) reaches; nothing is passed to the game.
//
// No room server is built in: a room's address is the player's to type, or picked from a lobby's list or this Wi-Fi's.
// The lobby comes set to a community one (settings_panel.cpp DEFAULT_LOBBY), and the player can type another or none.
// Everything here runs on the app's main thread (the interface's), but for the lobby's fetch, which has its own.
