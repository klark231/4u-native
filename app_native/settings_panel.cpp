// The in-game settings (settings_panel.h): the MHGU port's settings menu (runtime/settings_panel.cpp, its phone layout)
// made over for MH4U's options. Nearly the whole screen: a header with the title, Back (in a submenu or a question),
// Save and Close; the tabs in a column at the left, the rows in a list a finger drags, the picked row's explanation
// beside or under them; a row's choices in a picker of their own over the menu, dimmed; - and + on a number's row; an
// On / Off switch on a switch's. The colours are the touch controls' (touch.cpp): wine-dark plates with a bronze edge
// and a gold rule, cream letters, the picked row and tab lit ochre to gold as the game's cursor, the game's red and
// green rules along the window's top and bottom and gold studs on its corners.
//
// What it changes, and where:
//   - the port's options, mh4u.ini (game_options.h): the frame rate, the HUD at the edges, the screen filters, the
//     dither pattern and the Gameplay tab's buttons apply at once; the widescreen at the next start
//   - the app's own, mh4u-app.ini (app_settings.h): the 3D resolution and the volume at the next start (android_main.cpp
//     reads them), the touch screen's corner when the menu closes, the FPS counter, the haptics and the menu's own at once
//   - the touch controls' (touch_layout.txt, touch.h touch_setting / touch_set_setting) at once, and their layout
//     editor (touch_edit_begin) once the menu has closed
//   - the GPU driver (gpu_driver.h, Graphics & Audio): the system's or a player's own for an Adreno, at the next start;
//     importing and removing one at once
//   - the network rooms (net_rooms.h, the Multiplayer tab): join, leave, host and close at once, while the game runs;
//     the nickname, the addresses and the room's options in mh4u-app.ini's [Network], at Save or when a room is joined
//     or hosted with them. The room's chat and comings and goings show over the game for a moment while it is closed.
//   - mods and cheats (content.h, the Mods and Cheats tabs): the mods' order and switches in load/mods/load_order.txt at
//     Save, read at the next start; the cheats' switches at Save, in the game from its next frame, and in the cheats
//     file. Adding and removing either is done at once.
// Nothing changes until Save; leaving with something unsaved asks first. Text is typed on the menu's own keyboard (a
// view of keys in its style, which a controller works too), on a physical keyboard, or on the phone's if asked for.
