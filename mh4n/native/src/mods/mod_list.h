// The mods of the user folder (<user>/load/mods/), several at once, in an order the player picks: what the
// loader (the code mods) and the SelfNCCH archive (LayeredFS) apply, and what the app's Mods page shows and
// changes. Azahar reads one mods folder per title, <user>/load/mods/<title id>/; here every folder in
// load/mods is a mod:
//
//   load/mods/<name>/romfs/        files laid over the game's RomFS (LayeredFS)
//   load/mods/<name>/romfs_ext/    .stub, .ips and .bps over the game's RomFS files
//   load/mods/<name>/exefs/code.ips (code.bps, code.bin; also without exefs/): a code mod, applied to the
//                                   game's code at load. The code library is recompiled from the code,
//                                   so it must be made with the same code mods (tools/build_game.py --mods):
//                                   with others the runtime refuses it and the game does not start.
//   load/mods/0004000000126300/    Azahar's own layout: a mod like the others (named by the title id)
//
// A folder named as another title's id (16 hex digits) is not this game's and is left out; so is one whose
// name starts with '.' or '_'. load/mods/load_order.txt orders them and turns them off:
//
//   # Written by the Mods page ...        (comments)
//   SomeMod                               on, loaded first
//   # off: OtherMod                       off, keeping its place
//   0004000000126300                      on, loaded after SomeMod: where both change a file, this one wins
//
// A folder the list does not name loads after the listed ones, on, by name; a name without a folder is
// dropped. Without the file every folder is on, by name. load/mods/.from_game_folder names the mods the app
// copied from the mods folder beside the game (GameFolderActivity.syncMods), one per line.
