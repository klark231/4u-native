// The network rooms (N4-01, D7): Azahar's multiplayer rooms, an ENet server that relays the local-wireless frames of
// every member's console to the others, so MH4U's local play (the Gathering Hall, hunts together) works over the
// internet. The protocol is Azahar's, `network_version` 4, both ways: this client joins rooms of official Azahar, of the
// port's Azahar build (`azahar-room`, Create Room, the Docker room) and of another native runtime, and the room this
// process hosts takes all of them. The local-wireless service (nwm::UDS, native/src/services/nwm) carries the game's
// frames over the room the client is in.
//
// Threads: every function here may be called from any thread (the app's UI thread, a JNI thread, the game's). None
// blocks for long: Join and Leave start the work and return; the room client and the hosted room each run on a thread
// of their own. GetStatus and TakeEvents are how an app follows what happens: poll them (once a frame is plenty), or
// wait for `Status::revision` to change.
//
// A typical app:
//
//     mh4n::rooms::JoinRequest join;
//     join.host = "203.0.113.7";              // or a host name
//     join.port = mh4n::rooms::kDefaultPort;   // 24872
//     join.nickname = "Hunter One";            // 4 to 20 letters, digits, spaces, '.', '_', '-'
//     join.password = "";                      // the room's, if it has one
//     if (!mh4n::rooms::Join(join, &error)) { show(error); }
//     ...
//     const mh4n::rooms::Status status = mh4n::rooms::GetStatus();  // state, error, members, room
//     for (const mh4n::rooms::Event& event : mh4n::rooms::TakeEvents()) { ... chat, joins, leaves ... }
//     mh4n::rooms::SendChat("ready?");
//     mh4n::rooms::Leave();
//
// The console's identity: a room lets in one member per console ID (the SHA-256 of the console's unique ID, as Azahar's
// GetConsoleIdHash). With `JoinRequest::console_id_hash` empty the client uses the running game's, which the runtime
// publishes when it boots (PublishConsole); a Join made before the game boots waits for it, in state Joining. Two copies
// of one user folder have the same ID: give one a new ID first (`--new-console-id`).
//
// Hosting: Host opens a room in this process (Azahar's Create Room, or `azahar-room` without a game), then the app joins
// it like any other, at 127.0.0.1 and the hosted port. The room lives until CloseRoom (or the process ends), whether or
// not this console is in it.
